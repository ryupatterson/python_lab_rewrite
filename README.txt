When running these files, please try and run them in the directory where the python file exists. Although they were written so that this probably won't be an issue, if you encounter any errors please check what directory you are in.
Each lab has an answer_key directory. These will have a completed version of each lab. Please do not look at these until you have actually attempted to complete the labs yourselves. 

Lab 1: Numbers, Math Operators, Strings, and Lists
    - run "grade_python_lab1.py" once you've completed the lab to see if your code is correct

Lab 2: Functions
    - run "grade_python_lab2.py" once you've completed the lab to see if your code is correct

Lab 3: Directory Enumeration and File Manipulation
    - make sure you are in the lab3 directory when attempting this lab
    - there are no unit tests for this lab, the lab script gives you an opportunity to validate your
    answers when you run it

Lab 4: Log Ingestion
    - run "grade_python_lab4.py" once you've completed the lab to see if your code is correct
    - if you need to generate another sample_logs.py file, look in the data_generator directory and run the script there

Challenge Lab: Binary File Ingestion
    - make sure to take a look at the instruction word file/pdf
